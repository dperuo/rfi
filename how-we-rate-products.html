<h2>How We Rate Products</h2>
<p>Our mission at Renaissance Fitness is to simplify your life by offering only the best products and services. As part of that mission, we're constantly reviewing the options out there so you can make the best choice for your fitness goal. No one is paid to write these reviews. We make money by selling our <a href="#">supplements kits</a> and <a href="#">workout programs</a>. (Coming soon.)</p>
<p>We're instituting a star rating system across the board to help make life easier. Here's how it works:</p>
<h3 style="display: block; padding-top: 1em;">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</h3>
<p>The very best, most amazing products! Years of research support its use, and our reviewers saw positive results while testing the product. There are no major side effects, and the chance of injury is minimal. We use these products regularly and consider them Gold Standards for future reviews.</p>
<h3 style="display: block; padding-top: 1em;">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</h3>
<p>A fantastic product! Research supports its use, and our reviewers saw mostly positive results. There may be a few side effects, but chances of injury are still low. We use these products often and consider them great alternatives to a 5-star product.</p>
<h3 style="display: block; padding-top: 1em;">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;</h3>
<p>A good product. Research supports its use, but our reviewers saw mixed results. There are a few side effects, and the potential for injury. We use these products occasionally for short periods of time. A 4-star or 5-star product is always preferred.</p>
<h3 style="display: block; padding-top: 1em;">&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;</h3>
<p>A poor product. There's a lot of research, but the research is vague. Our reviewers saw no results. There are side effects and a definite risk of injury. We use these products sparingly, and always prefer an alternative.</p>
<h3 style="display: block; padding-top: 1em;">&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;</h3>
<p>A dangerous product. Little or no research is available for review and safety is suspect. Our reviewers saw negative results, experienced nasty side effects, or felt the risk of injury was very high. We avoid these products completely.</p>
