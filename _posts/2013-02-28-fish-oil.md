## [Star Rating:][] ★★★★☆

You're not eating enough Omega-3 fatty acids.

Years of research show consuming 250–1,000 mg of high-quality polyunsaturated Omega-3's per day can improve all sorts of issues, including coronary heart disease, hypertension, arthritis, asthma, hay fever, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, chronic fatigue, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Most importantly, Omega-3's reduce inflammation and pain from physical training, boost brain power and metabolism, reduce stress, lubricate joints, and lower body fat using doses as high as 6,000 mg.

But aren't fats bad for you?

Not true. In fact, when taken properly, Omega-3's actually lower triglycerides, VLDL, and LDL cholesterol while simultaneously raising healthy, HDL cholesterol. This helps reduce and reverse many heart-related issues.

Research also shows that Omega-3's are incredibly beneficial during pregnancy and fetal development: EPA and DHA lower the chance of preeclampsia, pre-term labor and breast cancer in the mother; and increase brain activity and improve sleep patterns in newborn children.

With all the positive research published on Omega-3's, they've truly become a staple supplement for nearly everyone.

But where do Omega-3's come from?

Omega-3 fats are a mixture of Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), and the best—most potent—source of EPA and DHA is fish oil.

Quality is vital when selecting a fish oil supplement and, after reviewing several different types, the team here at Renaissance Fitness feels Carlson Labs Super Omega-3 Fish Oil Gems is definitely among the best. That's why we included Carlson Labs fish oil in our [Basic Health Kit][].

Fish oil should contain plenty of Omega-3's. Carlson's Super Omega-3 Gems contain a combined 500 mg of EPA and DHA per serving from 100% Norwegian-quality deep, cold water fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, lake-trout and sardines. That's double the recommended minimum dose of 250 mg!

High-quality fish oil should also be free from soy and other fillers. Carlson Labs fish oil is preservative-free, cholesterol-free, gluten-free, and are regularly tested for freshness and potency by an independent, FDA-registered laboratory using AOAC international standards—all hallmarks of a top-notch product and producer.

The dreaded "fish burp" is the primary reason most people stop supplementing with fish oil. No one likes to smell like fish, and we agree. Carlson's fish oil is odorless and tasteless, and consuming the fish oil with food further minimized any residual aftertaste during our tests. Storing fish oil in the fridge or freezer is another way to avoid fish burps.

Scientific evidence to support fish oil is vast (e.g. [here][1], [here][2] and [here][3]. While the research is positive, there are a few possible side effects to consider before starting a fish oil supplement. Please remember to consult your doctor before starting any diet, exercise, or supplement plan:

Fish oils may decrease blood clotting when taken in conjunction with blood-thinning medications such as aspirin, warfarin or clopidogrel; or if you have a pre-existing condition that makes blood clotting difficult.

Fish oils may increase levels of micronutrients like vitamin A when taken in conjunction with other foods and supplements already high in vitamin A. High levels of Vitamin A can be dangerous.

Low-quality fish oils may contain harmful levels of heavy metals and other fat-soluble pollutants like PCB's and dioxins. Risk of contamination is reduced when consuming products manufactured by companies that voluntarily undergo independent testing and auditing of their products.

The fish oils themselves or the ingredients that make up the soft gel shell may cause an allergic reaction. If you're allergic, we recommend krill oil as a possible alternative.

If you would prefer to avoid animal products entirely, we suggest supplementing with Alpha-Linoleic Acid (ALA) instead. ALA is a plant-based Omega-3 fatty acid, and will provide many of the same benefits found in fish oil. Algae-based products may also be a good option.

If you’re already taking fish oil as part of your daily supplement regimen, keep going. If you're not, we highly encourage you to begin. Fish oil is a simple addition to any supplement plan.

Carlson Labs Super Omega-3 Gems fish oil can be purchased individually from our friends at [eVitamins.com][].

You can also purchase our [Basic Health Kit][], which includes a full month's supply of Carlson Labs fish oil in addition to Vitamin D3 and Probiotics.
