<h2><a href="/how-we-rate-products.html">Star Rating:</a> ★★★☆☆</h2>
<p>Elite Recoup from Dymatize Nutrition is formulated as a post-workout recovery supplement, helping reduce muscle soreness and shorten recovery time. The 7 grams of <a title="BCAA Branch Chain Amino Acid" href="http://examine.com/supplements/Branched+Chain+Amino+Acids/#summary">BCAA</a> and 40 mg of <a title="B Vitamin Complex" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins">B complex vitamins</a> per scoop allow for maximum recovery between workouts, so you avoid plateaus and reach your goals faster.</p>
<p>While formulated for recovery, I found this easy-to-use powder equally effective as a pre-workout stimulant thanks to the addition of Citrulline Malate and Vitamin B12.</p>
<p>Here's my favorite pre-workout cocktail:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 grams of high-quality creatine monohydrate</li>
<li>2 scoops of Elite Recoup</li>
<li>0.5 liters of water</li>
</ul>
<p>There were no obvious side effects while taking Elite Recoup, and the orange flavoring was fine. Grape and fruit punch flavors are also available.</p>
<p>If you're serious about weight loss or muscle gain, this easy-to-use amino acid formula is an excellent addition to your pre-workout and post-workout drinks!</p>
